* output pairs in one direction only
* if the n_pairs >= n_pairs_max, then everyone can be paired with everyone else
* use Carp::cluck and Carp::croak for warnings, and/or 'die' and 'eval'
* meaningful error or status reports, especially for perference list for which no stable matching is possible
* if all by all is possible with the desired number of rounds, list the pairings in each round
* allow for 'dislikes' - a list of people who someone would prefer not to talk to
* people in multiple locations
