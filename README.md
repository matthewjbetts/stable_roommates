# Introduction

A Perl implementation of Irving's algorithm for the stable roommates problem.

Unfortunately I haven't made much attempt yet to make it friendly for
people other than me to use.

Each person lists all the other people present that they would like to
talk to, in order of preference. The algorithm then attempts a 'stable
matching': to pair people up such thatÂ there is no pair where both
members prefer another partner to the one they have been paired
with. Such a pairing is not always possible.

## Adaptations to Irving's algorithm implemented in StableRoommmates

(I've not attempted a mathematical/computatioanl proof of any of these.)

### Incomplete preference lists
Irving's algorithm assumes that everyone has listed everyone else: if
you have X people, then everyone should have a prefence list X-1 long.
So I adapted it to allow for partial preference lists. All people not
listed by a particular person will be added on to the end of that
person's given preference list.

### Multiple rounds of pairing
Multiple rounds of pairing are possible, with pairings from previous
rounds removed from preference lists.

### Random pairings when no stable pairing is found
If no stable pairing is found in a particular round, people will be
paired randomly.
